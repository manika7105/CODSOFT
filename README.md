## Project 1: To-Do List 

### 📌 Task Overview:  

A **To-Do List Application📝** is a useful project that helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. This project involved creating a command-line application using Python, allowing users to add, update, delete, mark tasks as completed, and display their to-do list seamlessly.  

### 🛠️ Features:  

✅ **Add a Task** – Users can add new tasks to their list.  
✅ **Show Tasks** – Displays all tasks with their completion status.  
✅ **Update a Task** – Modify an existing task.  
✅ **Delete a Task** – Remove a task from the list.  
✅ **Mark as Completed** – Mark a task as done.  
✅ **User-Friendly Menu** – Interactive command-line interface with easy navigation.  

This task helped refine my Python skills, particularly in lists, dictionaries, functions, loops, and user interaction through the command line.  

### 🔧 Technologies Used:  
* **Python:** For core program logic and execution.
* **Lists and Dictionaries:**  Uses lists and dictionaries to store tasks.
* **User Input Handling:** Uses ```input()``` for interactive task management.
* **Conditional Statements:** ```if-elif-else``` to handle different options.
* **Looping:** ```while True``` to keep the program running until the user exits .

### 🚀 How to Run:  
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/manika7105/To-Do-List.git

2.  **Run the script:**
    python To-Do-List.py

3.  **Follow the interactive menu** to manage your tasks.

## Project 2: Calculator

### 📌 Task Overview:

The goal was to design a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations. The application prompts the user to input two numbers and choose an operation, then performs the calculation and displays the result.

### 🛠️ Features:

✅ Addition (+) – Adds two numbers.    
✅ Subtraction (-) – Subtracts one number from another.  
✅ Multiplication (*) – Multiplies two numbers.  
✅ Division (/) – Divides one number by another, ensuring no division by zero error.  
✅ User Input Handling – Ensures correct inputs and provides a smooth experience.  

This task helped me strengthen my understanding of conditional statements, user input handling, arithmetic operations, and program flow in Python.

### 🔧 Technologies Used: 

* **Python:** For core program logic and execution.
* **User Input Handling:** Uses ```input()``` to take user input.
* **Conditional Statements:** ```if-elif-else``` to handle different operations.
* **Looping:** ```while True``` to allow continuous calculations.
* **Error Handling:** Checks for division by zero. 

### 🚀 How to Run:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/manika7105/Calculator.git

2.  **Run the script:**
    python Calculator.py

3.  **Follow the interactive menu** to perform calculations.


## Project 3: Password Generator

### 📌 Task Overview:

A Password Generator is a powerful tool that helps users create strong and random passwords for better security. The goal of this project was to build a Python-based application that allows users to specify the password length and complexity while ensuring randomness and strength.

### 🛠️ Features:

✅ User Input – Allows users to specify the desired password length.  
✅ Random Password Generation – Uses a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.  
✅ Custom Complexity – Ensures strong and unpredictable passwords.  
✅ Instant Display – Generates and displays the password immediately.  

This task helped me improve my understanding of randomization, string manipulation, and user input handling in Python.

### 🔧 Technologies Used: 

* **Python:** For core program logic and execution.
* **Randomization:** Uses the ```random``` module to generate secure passwords.
* **String Manipulation:** Utilizes Python string methods to mix characters.
* **User Input Handling:** Allows users to specify password length and complexity.

### 🚀 How to Run:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/manika7105/Password-Generator.git

2.  **Run the script:**
    python PasswordGenerator.py

3.  **Enter the desired password length** and let the program generate a strong password instantly.


## Project 4: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game  

### 📌 Task Overview:  
The classic Rock-Paper-Scissors Game is a fun and interactive way to apply Python programming concepts. The goal was to develop a command-line application where the user competes against the computer in a fair, randomized game.

### 🛠️ Features:  
✅ User Input – Allows the player to choose rock, paper, or scissors.  
✅ Computer Selection – Randomly generates a choice for the computer.  
✅ Game Logic – Determines the winner based on standard rules:  
* Rock beats Scissors 🪨✂  
* Scissors beat Paper ✂📄  
* Paper beats Rock 📄🪨  
✅ Result Display – Shows the choices and announces the winner.  
✅ Score Tracking – Keeps track of the user's and computer’s scores.  
✅ Play Again Option – Allows multiple rounds of gameplay.  
✅ User-Friendly Interface – Provides clear instructions and feedback.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in randomization, conditional statements, loops, and user interaction in Python.

### 🔧 Technologies Used:  

* **Python:** For core program logic and execution.
* **Random Module:** Uses ```random.choice()``` to let the computer pick rock, paper, or scissors.
* **User Input Handling:** Uses ```input()``` to get the user's choice.
* **Conditional Statements:** ```if-elif-else``` to determine the game outcome.
* **Looping:** ```while True``` to keep the game running until the user decides to quit.
* **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of the user's and computer's scores.

### 🚀 How to Run:  

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/manika7105/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game.git

2.  **Run the script:**
    python RockPaperScissors.py

3.  **Enter rock, paper, or scissors,** the computer will randomly choose, the result will be displayed with score tracking, and type **quit** to exit and see the final scores. 


## Project 5: Contact Book

### 📌 Task Overview:
The Contact Book application is a simple yet powerful tool for storing, managing, and searching contacts efficiently. The goal of this project was to create a user-friendly system to handle contact details such as names, phone numbers, emails, and addresses.

### 🛠️ Features: 
✅ Add Contact – Allows users to store new contacts with all necessary details.  
✅ View Contact List – Displays all saved contacts with names and phone numbers.  
✅ Search Contact – Users can quickly find contacts by name or phone number.  
✅ Update Contact – Enables editing and updating contact details.  
✅ Delete Contact – Provides an option to remove unwanted contacts.
