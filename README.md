## Project 1: To-Do List 

📌 Task Overview:  
A **To-Do List Application📝** is a useful project that helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. This project involved creating a command-line application using Python, allowing users to add, update, delete, mark tasks as completed, and display their to-do list seamlessly.
