### 🚀 How to Run:  

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/manika7105/To-Do-List.git

2.  **Run the script:**
    python To-Do-List.py

3.  **Follow the interactive menu** to manage your tasks.


## Project 2: Calculator

### 📌 Task Overview:

A simple Calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 🛠️ Features:

✅ Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.  
✅ Handles invalid input and prevents division by zero errors.  
✅ Continuously allows calculations until the user exits. 

### 🔧 Technologies Used: 

* **Python:** Core programming language.
* **User Input Handling:** Uses ```input()``` to take user input.
* **Conditional Statements:** Uses ```if-elif-else``` for operations.
* **Looping:** ```while True``` to allow continuous calculations.
* **Error Handling:** Prevents division by zero. 

### 🚀 How to Run:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/manika7105/Calculator.git

2.  **Run the script:**
    python Calculator.py

3.  **Follow the interactive menu** to perform calculations.


## Project 3: Password Generator

### 📌 Task Overview:

A Password Generator 🔒 that creates strong, random passwords based on user-defined length and complexity.

### 🛠️ Features:

✅ Customizable password length.  
✅ Secure passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.   
✅ Instant password generation and display. 

### 🔧 Technologies Used: 

* **Python:** Core programming language.  
* **Randomization:** Uses the ```random``` module for secure password creation.  
* **String Manipulation:** Mixes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.  
* **User Input Handling:** Takes user-defined password length.

### 🚀 How to Run:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/manika7105/Password-Generator.git

2.  **Run the script:**
    python PasswordGenerator.py

3.  **Enter the desired password length** and receive a strong, random password.


## Project 4: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game  

### 📌 Task Overview:  

A Rock-Paper-Scissors Game 🎮 where the user plays against the computer. The computer randomly selects an option, and the game determines the winner.

### 🛠️ Features:  

✅ User chooses rock, paper, or scissors. 
✅ Computer randomly selects an option.
✅ Determine the winner based on standard rules.   
✅ Score tracking for multiple rounds.  
✅ Option to play again or quit. 

### 🔧 Technologies Used:  

* **Python:** Core programming language. 
* **Random Module:** Uses ```random.choice()``` for computer selection. 
* **User Input Handling:** Uses ```input()``` to get the user's choice.
* **Conditional Statements:** ```if-elif-else``` to determine the game outcome.
* **Looping:** ```while True``` to keep the game running until the user decides to quit.

### 🚀 How to Run:  

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/manika7105/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game.git

2.  **Run the script:**
    python RockPaperScissors.py

3.  **Enter rock, paper, or scissors.** The computer will randomly choose, display the result, track scores, and type **quit** to exit and see the final scores.


## Project 5: Contact Book

### 📌 Task Overview:

A Contact Book 📖 to store, manage, and search contacts efficiently. Users can add, view, update, and delete contacts.

### 🛠️ Features:  

✅ Add Contact – Store names, phone numbers, emails, and addresses.  
✅ View Contact List – Displays all saved contacts.  
✅ Search Contact – Find contacts by name or phone number. 
✅ Update Contact – Modify contact details. 
✅ Delete Contact – Remove unwanted contacts.  
✅ Interactive CLI – User-friendly command-line interface.  

### 🔧 Technologies Used:  

* **Python:** Core programming language.
* **Lists & Dictionaries:** Stores contact details.
* **User Input Handling:** Uses ```input()``` to  interact with users.
* **Conditional Statements:** ```if-elif-else``` for functionality.
* **Looping:** ```while True``` keeps the application running until the user exits. 

### 🚀 How to Run: 

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/manika7105/Contact-Book.git

2.  **Run the script:**
    python ContactBook.py

3.  **Enter a choice from the menu.** Add, view, search, update, or delete contacts by providing details, and select **Exit (6)** to close the application. 



## 🚀 Conclusion / Summary

This internship at **CodSoft** helped me strengthen my Python skills by working on real-world applications. I improved my understanding of **user interaction, loops, and error handling**. These projects not only enhanced my coding ability but also gave me hands-on experience in **problem-solving and project development**.

## 🔥 Future Improvements

Here are some potential improvements for these projects:

- 🖥️ **GUI Implementation** – Add a graphical interface for the **To-Do List** and **Contact Book** using **Tkinter** or **PyQt**.
- 🔐 **Password Strength Analysis** – Enhance the **Password Generator** by evaluating and rating password strength.
- 🎮 **Multiplayer Rock-Paper-Scissors** – Convert the **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game** into a **multiplayer web-based version**.
- 📊 **Data Persistence** – Implement **database storage (SQLite or JSON)** for saving contact details in the **Contact Book**.

These improvements would further refine the applications and make them more robust and user-friendly.
